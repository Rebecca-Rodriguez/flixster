### Notes
Describe any challenges encountered while building the app.
I had challenges in the last step. I had difficulty installing the pods and having the posters appear on the app.

I also had challenges adding the GIF file to hackmd. I will attach it in my final submission. The website would not allow me to drag the gif to the text file to create the URL.
